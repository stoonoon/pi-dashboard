# pi-dashboard

This is a simple dashboard for a Raspberry pi with the 7" 800x480 touchscreen.

On the left it displays a list of any uncompleted tasks pulled from Google Tasks, and on the right are some basic controls for some Sonos speakers.

todo:
Turn whole screen into backlight on button if backlight is currently off
Improve the now playing section so that it displays better info for podcasts and radio (if possible)
General UI layout / appearance improvements

not looking possible:
Triggering Mixcloud "Listen Later" / Pocketcasts "New Releases" etc playlists.... seems like Sonos is blocking API access to 3rd party music services. Bit of a shame, but not critical & I'm not sure how much time I want to invest in trying to find a workaround
